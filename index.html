  <h2>WELCOME TO MY LIFE</h2>
  <b><p>
    A little about me,<br>My name is Bar Pernichi, i'm 24 years old. I live in Ness Ziona.<br>I grew up in the city of Lod in the Gani Aviv neighborhood where I studied at an elementary school called Zebulon Amer until the third grade, then I moved to Nes Ziona and studied there at the Hadar elementary school. After that, I attended Begin Middle School, which later merged with Ben Gurion High School, where I attended high school. I graduated with a full high school education with first class honors.
I finished high school and then the army came, I decided that I wanted to continue the tradition in my family and do formation for the paratrooper unit. The formation was difficult but in the end I passed it and enlisted in the 202nd battalion of the paratroopers brigade. About four months into my training, I got injured in a mega fight training session and the patella of my knee came out of place. They had to evacuate me to the hospital to bring her back to me. This injury changed my entire service, my profile dropped to 64 and I moved to become a command sergeant and finished my service in this position after two years and eight months. After the service, I started working at the Isracard credit company. I planned to take a big trip after the army but then the corona virus started and I took advantage of the time and enrolled in computer science studies at the Academic College of Law and Business.
