  <h2>MY HOBBIES</h2>
  <p>
    All my life I was involved in sports from a very young age. I started in various martial arts: Krav Maga, Thai boxing, karate, ninjutsu, etc.
In addition to all of this in the 5th grade I started playing at the handball school in Ness Ziona where I continued for about 8 years. I became a professional player in the handball league. I was also in the Israeli national team but unfortunately in the 11th grade I injured my knee during a training game and had to stop playing and retire which completely destroyed my dream of doing it all my life. I went to a lot of doctors, mostly orthopedists, who told me that I couldn't go back to playing and there were even some who said that I probably wouldn't be able to go back to running anymore. I took it very hard, I got a little depressed, nevertheless I stopped doing what I love the most. But I decided not to give up and concentrate on my recovery and slowly after many physical therapies with many different doctors I was able to go back to running. But because the injury was severe I could not return to play for fear of the same thing happening again and I would have to undergo surgery.<br><br> I am adding is a clip of handball so you can see what it's about by my favorite player Luce Abalo, and also a video of my favorite Thai boxer and my favorite song
